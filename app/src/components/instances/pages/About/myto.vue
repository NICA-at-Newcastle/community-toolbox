            | By using this site and posting comments and other contributions, you are indicating your consent for your anonymous contributions to be included in a larger programme of research at Newcastle University surrounding mitochondrial disease and the participatory design of ideas for those living with the condition.
            br
            br
            | Investment funds will be awarded commensurate to the amount of effort, work and time that the idea’s production will require. This will be decided by independent experts in software development, as advised by experts within the domains of mitochondrial disease.
            | Invested projects will be announced on the platform, but also via email sign-up lists. The site will also periodically be updated during the process of design and deployment to ensure participants are kept u| to date with the process.

            | Although we are not anticipating that all/any fully-functioning technologies will necessarily be developed as part of invested projects, any technology or platform developed as a part of this competition must be open-source. This is in line with Open Lab at Newcastle University’s long-standing open source policy. Please contact us if you have any more questions about this.

            | If any technology is developed, there will be a handover process whereby the technology will be submitted to the SAgE (at Newcastle University)’s Enterprise Team, will be submitted to ethical approval boards, and then will be made available to the community via the usual channels. This is, of course, highly dependent on the nature of the invested technology.
            | Where the winning idea is a mobile application or piece of software, the developed technology must be compatible with both iOS and Android – this is for reasons of health equality (e.g., not everyone has an iPhone – and this is even more important to pay attention to in challenging contexts such as mitochondrial disease).
            | Output from the project – whether it be participants’ comments during the early stages or invested contributions - may be used in post-promotion publicity.
            | Ideaboard reserves the right to make changes to information published in this guidelines document, including without limitation, specifications and product descriptions, at any time and without notice.
