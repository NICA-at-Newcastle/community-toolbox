            p Ideaboard is a new way of involving your friends/community/colleagues in shaping your latest idea. More than just a feedback tool, Ideaboard is a collaborative space to develop any project.
            p Want to involve students in the design of a course? How about planning your upcoming event with the help of attendees? Or do you simply want a place where your bookclub buddies can hang out, chat and plan meetups? Ideaboard does all this and more.
            p Getting started on Ideaboard is easy, with a few clicks you can launch an idea page and start inviting people to subscribe and collaborate.
            p Start the conversation straight away in the general discussion, then you and your community can add 'tasks' such as polls and discussions to help shape your idea.
            p You can post regular updates to keep everyone notified, and use our custom planning tools to organise your idea. 
            p What makes Ideaboard different?
            p Unlike other platforms, Ideaboard is designed with community at its heart. We believe that any idea can be improved by including more passionate voices. Thatâ€™s why all our tools are open for everyone to use.
            p On Ideaboard, anyone who subscribes to your idea can ask questions, set polls and offer their expertise! So much better than a survey, this is genuine, real collaboration between you and your audience.
            p So what are you waiting for?
