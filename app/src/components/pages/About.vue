          p Say goodbye to surveys!
          p Ideaboard is a revolutionary new way of involving your audience in shaping your latest idea. More than just a feedback tool, Ideaboard lets a community come together to collaboratively design any project.
          p Want to involve your students in the design of a course? How about planning your upcoming event with the help of attendees? Or do you simply want a place where your bookclub buddies can hang out, chat and plan meetups? Ideaboard does all this and more.
          p Getting started on Ideaboard is easy, with a few clicks you can launch your idea page and start inviting people to collaborate and subscribe.
          p Start the conversation straight away in the general discussion, and use custom polls, schedulers and other talking points to start involving your subscribers in shaping your idea.
          p You can post regular updates to keep everyone notified, and use our custom planning tools to organise your idea. 
          p What makes Ideaboard different?
          p Unlike other platforms, Ideaboard is designed with community at its heart. We believe that any idea can be improved by including more passionate voices. Thatâ€™s why all our tools are open for everyone to use.
          p On Ideaboard, anyone who subscribes to your idea can ask questions, set polls and offer their expertise! So much better than a survey, this is genuine, real collaboration between you and your audience.
